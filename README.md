### Self-Assessment
Among the team I orchestrated the version control using git and [git hub](www.github.com) since I had the most prior experience using git.

I was also in charge of creating the Dashboard display using Tableau.

For roles I did not take on personally, I, and the rest of the team, contributed to everything. Before anything was merged into the `main` branch I applied a rule so that each pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least two members of the team.

The greatest personal challange was scheduling team meetings and keeping up with work and the other things going on in my life. Slack as well as other calander and reminder tools made this easier.

### Team Assessment
We used Slack to communicate amongst the team, and we would meet through Zoom to video chat. There were some challanges with myself because for part of the project I was travelling for work. The rest of the team was accomidating for my tricky schedule, and I accomidated them in turn by meeting at unusual (local) times.

Some of our teams strengths were the positive outlook each member had. They were all a joy to work with which will really make a world of difference, especially when the work gets hard.

### Summary of Project
This dataset is recruitment data for a National Institutes of Health research program called You and U.S.(de-identified name). The goal of the program is to build up a database for [Precision Medicine.](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/precision-medicine)

We specifically were looking to see if there were demographic predictors for a completed visit. We used a Random Forest Classifier model. We got a number of interesting results showcased in this [Tableau Dashboard.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hunter.matthews1794/viz/data_final_16679632324350/Story1?publish=yes)
